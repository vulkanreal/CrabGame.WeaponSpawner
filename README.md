A CG mod to spawn weapons in your server
thats my very first Crab Game mod so dont expect much

# how to use it:
- download [Bepinex](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be/577/BepInEx_UnityIL2CPP_x64_ec79ad0_6.0.0-be.577.zip)
- open your game folder (on steam, right click Crab Game, manage > browse local files)
- extract Bepinex in the folder
- run the game once
- then close it
- download `weaponspawner.dll` from [Releases](https://github.com/vulkanreal/CrabGame.WeaponSpawner/releases)
- move `weaponspawner.dll` to your game folder `(Game Folder from step 2)/BepInEx/plugins/weaponspawner.dll`

NOTE: you can only spawn weapons if you are the host of the server
NOTE 2: you cant spawn shotguns so people cant cheat with this mod

have fun with it!
